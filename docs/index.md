This page represents the document profiles (Danish: dokumentprofiler) used in MedComs FHIR®© standards. These profiles describe fundamental information when exchanging information as MedCom Documents. Therefore one or more document profiles are included in all MedCom’s FHIR documents. The MedCom Document profiles do not alone compose a standard but are used to describe important information in MedCom’s standards. Thus, this page includes the IG solely, and technical uses cases and does not include clinical guidelines and test protocols.
 
> Clinical Guidelines for application and use cases are in both Danish and English. The remaining documentation will be in English.

### 1.1 Use Cases

Use cases describe the different scenarios a standard support. For a certain real-world scenario, it describes the requirements for the content of a Medcom Document. The purpose of the use cases is to ensure a coherent implementation and use of the MedCom Document. The descriptions are targeted IT-system vendors and the people responsible for the implementation in regions and municipalities.

The use cases are qualified in collaboration with EPR- and vendors catering to the municipalities.

Below, you can find the use cases in Danish and English:

The profiles that are part of the technical specification for a MedCom Document are:

The link below gives an overview of the included profiles, what their purpose is, and which elements the system should support. Further, the structure of the standard is described and supported with examples in different degree of technical skills.

### 1.3 Mapping from IHE-XDS metadata to FHIR to FHIR
Short description concerning the previous XXXXX standard??? that is replaced by the MedCom Document. 
The document is intended to help translate the previous standard to the new FHIR standard. Furthermore, not all elements from the FHIR elements are represented in the MedCom Document; thus, it cannot stand alone for implementation.
