This page represents the MedCom Document profiles (Danish: Dokumentprofiler) used in MedComs FHIR®© standards. These profiles describe fundamental information when exchanging information as MedCom Documents. Therefore one or more document profiles are included in all MedCom’s FHIR Documents. The MedCom’s FHIR document profiles do not alone compose a standard but are used to describe important information in MedCom’s standards. Thus, this page includes the IG solely, and technical uses cases and does not include clinical guidelines and test protocols.
 
> Clinical Guidelines for application and use cases are in both Danish and English. The remaining documentation will be in English.

## 1 Standard Documentation {#standard}
The standard documentation below provides the necessary content to understand the needs for modernization, the role of the MedCom Document, what to implement and how to get a MedCom certificate. The standard documentation for a MedCom Document includes:
  * Clinical Guidelines
  * Use cases
  * Technical Specifications in terms of the relevant IGs and clinical introduction to the content of the IG.
  * *mention other relevant documentation*
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 1.1 Clinical Guidelines for application
The Clinical Guidelines for application is the foundation for the MedCom Document standard. It describes the clinical needs for the modernization, the requirement for the content of the standard and how the standard supports the business requirements. It is the primary textual part of the documentation for a MedCom Document. It is important for both implementers and business specialists to understand the Clinical Guidelines for application to ensure that the implemented standard supports the requirements.

Below, you can find the Clinical Guidelines for use in both Danish and English.:

[Danish: Sundhedsfaglige retningslinjer for anvendelse](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-DA.md) <br> 
[English: Clinical guidelines for application](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-ENG.md) 

### 1.2 Use Cases

Use cases describe the different scenarios a standard support. For a certain real-world scenario, it describes the requirements for the content of a document. The purpose of the use cases is to ensure a coherent implementation and use of the MedCom Document. The descriptions are targeted IT-system vendors and the people responsible for the implementation in regions and municipalities.

The use cases are qualified in collaboration with EPR- and vendors catering to the municipalities.

Below, you can find the use cases in Danish and English:

[English: Use cases](assets/documents/UseCases-ENG.md) 

### 1.3 Technical specification

The technical specification for the MedCom Document standard is composed by profiles form *IG name* 

The profiles that are part of the technical specification for a MedCom Document are: 
 * *Insert link to ImplemantationGuides*

The link below gives an overview of the included profiles, what their purpose is, and which elements the system should support. Further, the structure of the standard is described and supported with examples in different degree of technical skills.

### 1.4 Mapping from OIOXML (HVOR MAPPER VI FRA? HUSK OGSÅ INDHOLDSFORTEGNELSEN) to FHIR
Short description concerning the previous OIOXML standard (HVILKEN ERSTATTER VI HER?) that is replaced by the MedCom Document. 
The document is intended to help translate the previous standard to the new FHIR standard.Furthermore, not all elements from the FHIR elements are represented in the document; thus, it cannot stand alone for implementation. 

## 2 Test and Certification
Certification of a system implies both an approved testprotocol and run-through of TouchStone test scripts. TouchStone describes an infrastructure that allows for automated test and validation against the IG's developed by MedCom.
